Project 4 is a combination of the lateral dynamics from Project 2 and the longitudinal dynamics from Project 3. The driver model was improved and regenerative braking was added. The car completes 22 laps of the track, with the hour time limit starting with an initial state of charge of 80%. However, there is an issue with the regen braking violation and 'brake_viol' always returns 'True', even when adding the necessary logic.

To run, download the files FinalRace.m, P4init.m, raceStat.m, genTrack.m and P4_car.slx. Then run the FinalRace.m file. THe programwill then run the simulation and output the required information from raceStat.m.
